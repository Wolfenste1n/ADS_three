# Algorithms and Data Structures Third Assignment
# by Madiyar Kenzhebayev SE-2407
## Started by using code in Moodle
### Tested HashTable and BST in Main
### Complited all requirements from Moodle and Lecture video

# Main
1. Run this file to start the program
2. Get results of testing HashTable(described by order of Buckets and  number of Elements)
3. Get reults of testing BST(described by its Size, key, values and etc...)

## Time Complexity

### MyHashTable
- `put`, `get`, `remove`: average **O(1)**, worst **O(n)**
- `bucketSize`: **O(k)**, where k = bucket length

### BST
- `put`, `get`, `delete`: average **O(log n)**, worst **O(n)**
- `iterator`: **O(n)**
